# 😁 Hi! I'm Dostoievski Batista
But everyone calls me **Dosto**! I like to mess with computers and tech stuff!
Here you will find some repositories containing technologies I use everyday or some that I'm still learning.

You should find a **README.md** file in every repository that will give a glimpse of what I'm doing there, which technologies I used and how I applied them.
