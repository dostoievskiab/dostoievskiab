# 😁 Hi! I'm Dostoievski Batista
But everyone calls me Dosto! I like to mess with computers and tech stuff!

Here you will find some of my work, they are mainly divided by two topics:
- **[learning](https://github.com/dostoievskiab?tab=repositories&q=topic%3Alearning)** - where you will find repositories containing technologies I use everyday or some that I'm still learning.
- **[interview-test](https://github.com/dostoievskiab?tab=repositories&q=topic%3Ainterview-test)** - repositories containing interview test that I have done for companies.

You should find a **README.md** file in every repository that will give a glimpse of what that repository is for, which technologies I used and how I applied them.
